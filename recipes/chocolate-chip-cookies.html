        <p>These are the yummiest, the <em>ooiest</em>, the <em><strong>GOOEIST</strong></em> cookies that you or your momma or your memaw or your pappy or your great memaw has ever seen! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, soft as a baby's bottom</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar, and pack it good</li>
            <li>2 eggs, unfertilized</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soda, but the baking kind, not the other kind</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of piping hot yummy water</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flowers</li>
            <li>Actually, I've been told it's actually <em>flour</em>, not flowers, so sorry if you missed that note before.</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped nuts from inside of your wall</li>
            <li>Again, so sorry, I've now been informed that they're called walnuts and don't come from the walls.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather your ingredients. Why do I even have to tell you that? Seriously?</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350 freedom degrees (or whatever your local equivalent of that is).</li>
            <li>Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together. But not too hard, just enough to send a message.</li>
            <li>Beat in eggs, one a time for your safety, then stir in vanilla.</li>
            <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt.</li>
            <li>Stir in flowers, chocolate chips, and nuts of the wall.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Make sure not to put them too closely together, 2 inches is more than you'd think.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes depending on your elevation. Good luck figuring out how long it actually is supposed to be, because I sure haven't been able to.</li>
            <li>Let them cool so as not to burn your precious little fingies</li>
            <li><strong>Profit!</strong></li>
        </ol>
